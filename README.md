Replace the standards settings of you Philips HUE Light on start.

This small script allows you to change the standard setting of you Philips HUE  on start.
I considere it a shame that my Lights (A60) have no record of settings, and must therefore be reinitialized on each switch.

You have to press the bridge button to connect with the applicatin on start.

Error Messages ( Connection failure with Bridge) / Light On infos are sent by email.

A Raspberry PI is the perfect tool to use it.
